## Advent of Code 2019

These are my personal solutions for the current Advent of Code 2019. They are all written in C++11, can be compiled and run through g++

My solutions aren't perfect by any means: I just want to make them work, while also maintaining a sane level of "elegance" to my code.

I will post new solutions here and updates to my previous ones, comments are kindly accepted (you can leave them as "issues" ahah)	

You can find the puzzles here: https://adventofcode.com/2019

I consider a puzzle solved when I've actually solved both parts of it. Atm I've solved:

- Day 1 - The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation
- Day 2 - 1202 Program Alarm
- Day 3 - Crossed Wires
- Day 4 - Secure Container
- Day 5 - Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids
- Day 6 - Universal Orbit Map
- Day 7 - Amplification Circuit (only Part 1)
- Day 8 - Space Image Format
